## Why Agent Vault

Secret managers return credentials directly to the caller. This breaks down with AI agents, which are non-deterministic systems vulnerable to prompt injection that can be tricked into exfiltrating secrets.

Agent Vault takes a different approach: **Agent Vault never reveals vault-stored credentials to agents**. Instead, agents route HTTP requests through a local proxy that injects the right credentials at the network layer.

- **Brokered access, not retrieval** - Your agent gets a token and a proxy URL. It sends requests to `proxy/{host}/{path}` and Agent Vault authenticates them. Credentials stored in the vault are never returned to the agent. [Learn more](https://docs.agent-vault.dev/learn/security)
- **Works with any agent** - Custom Python/TypeScript agents, sandboxed processes, coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex), anything that can make HTTP requests. [Learn more](https://docs.agent-vault.dev/quickstart)
- **Self-service access** - Agents discover available services at runtime and [propose access](https://docs.agent-vault.dev/learn/proposals) for anything missing. You review and approve in your browser with one click.
- **Encrypted at rest** - Credentials are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using an Argon2id-derived key. The master password never touches disk. [Learn more](https://docs.agent-vault.dev/learn/credentials)
- **Multi-user, multi-vault** - Role-based access control with instance and vault-level [permissions](https://docs.agent-vault.dev/learn/permissions). Invite teammates, scope agents to specific [vaults](https://docs.agent-vault.dev/learn/vaults), and audit everything.

## Installation

See the [installation guide](https://docs.agent-vault.dev/installation) for full details.

### Script (macOS / Linux)

Auto-detects your OS and architecture, downloads the latest release, and installs. Works for both fresh installs and upgrades (backs up your database before upgrading).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/agent-vault/main/install.sh | sh
```

Supports macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon) and Linux (x86_64 + ARM64).

### [Docker](https://docs.agent-vault.dev/self-hosting/docker)

```bash
docker run -it -p 14321:14321 -p 14322:14322 -v agent-vault-data:/data infisical/agent-vault
```

Port `14322` exposes the transparent HTTPS proxy (on by default) — omit the mapping or pass `--mitm-port 0` to the server if you only need the explicit `/proxy/{host}/{path}` API on `14321`.

### From source

Requires [Go 1.25+](https://go.dev/dl/) and [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Infisical/agent-vault.git
cd agent-vault
make build
sudo mv agent-vault /usr/local/bin/
```

## Quickstart

```bash
# Start the server (HTTP on 14321, transparent HTTPS proxy on 14322)
agent-vault server -d

# Add a credential
agent-vault vault credential set GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx

# Add a service proxy rule
agent-vault vault service add \
  --host api.github.com \
  --auth-type bearer \
  --token-key GITHUB_TOKEN
```

The transparent MITM proxy binds `127.0.0.1:14322` by default so clients configured with `HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:14322` route through Agent Vault without code changes — install the root CA with `agent-vault ca fetch`, or disable the proxy entirely with `--mitm-port 0`.

For local debugging, start the server with `--log-level debug` (or set `AGENT_VAULT_LOG_LEVEL=debug`) to emit one structured line per proxied request on stderr — method, host, path, matched broker service, injected credential key names, upstream status, duration. Credential *values* are never logged.

Any command that needs authentication will walk you through setup automatically. Just run it and follow the prompts. You can also run `agent-vault vault service set` interactively, load from YAML with `agent-vault vault service set -f services.yaml`, or browse templates with `agent-vault catalog`.

The server includes a web UI at `http://localhost:14321` for managing services, credentials, approving proposals, and inviting users and agents.

### Building custom agents

Mint a session token and pass it to your agent process. The agent authenticates every request through the proxy. No credentials in its environment.

```bash
# Mint a scoped session token
export AGENT_VAULT_SESSION_TOKEN=$(agent-vault vault token)
export AGENT_VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:14321
```

From your agent code, proxy requests through Agent Vault:

```typescript
const vault = process.env.AGENT_VAULT_ADDR;
const token = process.env.AGENT_VAULT_SESSION_TOKEN;

// Proxy an authenticated request (Agent Vault injects the credentials)
const resp = await fetch(`${vault}/proxy/api.github.com/user/repos`, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
});
```

If a service isn't configured yet, the agent can [propose access](https://docs.agent-vault.dev/learn/proposals) via `POST /v1/proposals`. You approve in your browser and the agent retries.

### Using with coding agents

Wrap your coding agent with `vault run` for automatic session management:

```bash
agent-vault vault run -- claude    # Claude Code
agent-vault vault run -- cursor    # Cursor
agent-vault vault run -- codex     # Codex

# Or create an invite for any agent
agent-vault agent invite my-agent
```

`vault run` injects `AGENT_VAULT_SESSION_TOKEN`, `AGENT_VAULT_ADDR`, and `AGENT_VAULT_VAULT` into the child process. The agent discovers services, proxies requests, and proposes access for anything missing.

## Development

```bash
make build      # Build frontend + Go binary
make test       # Run tests
make web-dev    # Vite dev server with hot reload (port 5173)
make dev        # Go + Vite dev servers with hot reload
make docker     # Build Docker image
```
