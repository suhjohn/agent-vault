# Agent Vault

Open-source credential broker for AI agents. Agents access services without ever seeing the underlying credentials.

## Why

Traditional secret managers return credentials directly to the caller. This breaks down with AI agents, which are non-deterministic and vulnerable to prompt injection. An attacker can craft a malicious prompt and exfiltrate credentials from the agent.

Agent Vault takes a different approach: agents never receive credentials. They route requests through Agent Vault, and Agent Vault attaches credentials on their behalf.

```
Agent ────▶ Agent Vault Proxy ────▶ api.stripe.com
(no creds)    (attaches              (receives real
               credentials)           Authorization header)
```

- **Brokered access, not retrieval.** Agents route requests through a proxy. There is nothing to leak because agents never have credentials.
- **Self-onboarding.** Paste an invite prompt into any agent's chat and it connects itself. No env setup, no config files.
- **Agent-led access.** The agent discovers what it needs at runtime and raises a proposal. You approve in your browser.

## Install

### GitHub Releases (macOS / Linux)

Download the latest binary for your platform from
[Releases](https://github.com/Infisical/agent-vault/releases/latest), then:

```bash
# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -Lo agent-vault.tar.gz https://github.com/Infisical/agent-vault/releases/latest/download/agent-vault_0.1.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
tar xzf agent-vault.tar.gz
sudo mv agent-vault /usr/local/bin/

# macOS (Intel)
curl -Lo agent-vault.tar.gz https://github.com/Infisical/agent-vault/releases/latest/download/agent-vault_0.1.0_darwin_amd64.tar.gz
tar xzf agent-vault.tar.gz
sudo mv agent-vault /usr/local/bin/

# Linux (x86_64)
curl -Lo agent-vault.tar.gz https://github.com/Infisical/agent-vault/releases/latest/download/agent-vault_0.1.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar xzf agent-vault.tar.gz
sudo mv agent-vault /usr/local/bin/

# Linux (ARM64)
curl -Lo agent-vault.tar.gz https://github.com/Infisical/agent-vault/releases/latest/download/agent-vault_0.1.0_linux_arm64.tar.gz
tar xzf agent-vault.tar.gz
sudo mv agent-vault /usr/local/bin/
```

### Docker

```bash
docker run -it -p 14321:14321 -v agent-vault-data:/data infisical/agent-vault
```

### From source

Requires [Go 1.25+](https://go.dev/dl/) and [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Infisical/agent-vault.git
cd agent-vault
make build
sudo mv agent-vault /usr/local/bin/
```

### Verify a release (optional)

Every release includes SHA-256 checksums and a [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) signature for supply-chain security. No keys to manage — verification uses GitHub's OIDC identity.

```bash
# Download the checksums and signature bundle from the release page, then:

# 1. Verify the binary hasn't been tampered with
sha256sum --check checksums.txt

# 2. Verify the checksums were signed by the Infisical/agent-vault GitHub Actions workflow
cosign verify-blob \
  --bundle checksums.txt.bundle \
  --certificate-identity-regexp "github.com/Infisical/agent-vault" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  checksums.txt
```

## Quick start

```bash
agent-vault server -d

# Register (first user becomes owner) and log in
agent-vault register
agent-vault login

# Launch your agent through Agent Vault
agent-vault vault run -- claude
```

Ask the agent to call an external API. It discovers available services, proposes access for anything missing, and presents you with a browser link to approve.
